User Management: Allows the addition of users with random phone numbers and balances for testing purposes.
Recharge Functionality: Users can recharge their phone balances by entering their phone number and the ticket number they wish to use.
Feedback Display: Utilizes a dynamic message label to provide feedback to users about the success or failure of recharge attempts.
User Interface: Mimics the interface of a phone application, allowing users to input phone numbers and ticket numbers using a simulated keypad.
