                                                    Recharge Telephone Application
This project is a simple recharge telephone application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides users with a graphical interface to recharge their phone balances using recharge tickets.

                                                            Features:
Ticket Generation: Automatically generates recharge telephone tickets with values of $1, $2, $5, and $10, with expiry dates set to 10 days from the current date.
User Management: Allows the addition of users with random phone numbers and balances for testing purposes.
Recharge Functionality: Users can recharge their phone balances by entering their phone number and the ticket number they wish to use.
Feedback Display: Utilizes a dynamic message label to provide feedback to users about the success or failure of recharge attempts.
User Interface: Mimics the interface of a phone application, allowing users to input phone numbers and ticket numbers using a simulated keypad.
                                                            Technologies Used:
Python: Backend logic and database management.
Tkinter: GUI development for the phone application interface.
SQLite: Database management for storing recharge tickets and user information.
